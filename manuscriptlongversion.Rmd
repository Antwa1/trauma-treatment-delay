# Introduction

Within the realm of modern medicine, trauma care stands as an important part in healthcare and is crucial to lowering mortality and morbidity in injured patients. The definition of medical trauma is "a set of psychological and physiological responses to pain, injury, serious illness, medical procedures and frightening treatment experiences" [@International_Society_for_Traumatic_Stress_Studies_2020]. As the definition suggests, it encompasses a broad spectrum of different conditions, both physical and psychological. The one we will be focusing on in this paper is physical trauma, which is defined as a serious injury to the body. It is often divided into two subgroups, blunt force trauma and penetrative trauma. Blunt force trauma happens when an object or force strikes the body, often causing bruising, broken bones or deep cuts. Examples of this could be car crashes, falls or direct blows to the body. Penetrative trauma is when an object pierces the skin or body and creates an open wound. Examples of this are gunshot wounds and stab wounds [@National_Institute_of_General_Medical_Sciences_2020].

Trauma is and has long been a major cause of death around the world today, taking the lives of around 4,4 million people each year, almost 8% of all deaths [@World_Health_Organization_2021]. In the United States, trauma is the 4th leading cause of death among the general population and the leading cause for people between the ages of 1 and 44 [@AAST_2020]. It is also an important cause of hospitalization and morbidity among all age groups, including seniors, and is responsible for an estimated 10% of all years lived with a disability globally. This has a significant burden on social and economic level, costing countries billions of US dollars each year in healthcare and lost productivity. [@connolly_woo_lampron_perry_2018] [@World_Health_Organization_2021]. To combat this, trauma systems and dedicated trauma centers exist that have been shown to lower mortality but also improve functional outcome in trauma patients [@Nirula_Brasel_2006].

Trauma systems are infrastructures that exist to provide and optimize care for injured patients starting with injury recognition and triage, transport to appropriate trauma center, inpatient care and outpatient follow-up. Beyond the clinical side, it works with outreach, education and advocacy, data collection through registries, research, funding, and disaster preparedness and response. A comprehensive and functioning trauma system requires strong leadership and engagement at the trauma center, regional and national level [@connolly_woo_lampron_perry_2018]. This system is crucial to provide care for trauma patients, both in reducing morbidity and mortality in this patient group. Some studies have shown that treating severely injured patients at one of these establishments is associated with a 15-32% decrease in mortality due to them being more capable of treating these patients [@Candefjord_Asker_Caragounis_2020].

Trauma teams are multidisciplinary and operate in these centers. They consist of individuals from the specialties of emergency medicine, surgery, intensive care, nursing and support staff and are lead by a team leader. Their aim is to rapidly assess and stabilise the patient, prioritise their injuries and arrange for site of definitive care. Emergency physicians are often the personnel activating the trauma code using anatomical and physiological criteria, mechanism of injury and information obtained from emergency service personnel.

Trauma patients brought to trauma centers may receive immediate or delayed treatment depending on what protocols are present at the facility and how they are being followed [@ryb2012delayed]. Among the preventable or possibly preventable deaths in trauma patients, a group determined by the Combined Trauma Death Review Committee, delay in treatment has been identified as a major error contributing to death, found in up to 52.9% of patients in said group according to studies [@Teixeira_Inaba_Hadjizacharia_Brown_Salim_Rhee_Browder_Noguchi_Demetriades_2007]. In the case of a delayed trauma team activation (DTTA) it can often be attributed to insensitivity in triage protocol and failure to recognize injury patterns [@Hoyt_Hollingsworth-Fridlund_Winchell_Simons_Holbrook_Fortiage_1994]. Studies have also shown that different factors such as age over 55, nonwhite ethnicity, blunt assault among others was linked to a higher risk of DTTA [@ryb2012delayed].

In this paper our aim is to determine what different patient level factors affect the risk of receiving delayed treatment at a trauma center.

# Methods

This is a registry based cohort study using data from the trauma registry and trauma care quality database at the Karolinska University Hospital in Solna. The trauma registry includes about 12000 patients treated between 2012 and 2022. The trauma care quality database is a subset of the trauma registry and includes about 6000 patients selected for review between 2014 and 2022. The outcome is delayed treatment, as identified by the multidisciplinary review board and recorded in the trauma care quality database. This project will link the two databases and assess how different patient level factors, such as age, sex, mechanism of injury, and injury severity, are associated with delayed treatment using logistic regression. A 5% significance level and 95% confidence levels will be used.
