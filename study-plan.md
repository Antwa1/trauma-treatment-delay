Introduction
============
Injury is still a major cause of death around the world, taking the lives of around 4,4 million people each year, almost 8% of all deaths [@World_Health_Organization_2021]. In the United States, trauma is the 4th leading cause of death among the general population and the leading cause for people between the ages of 1 and 44 [@AAST_2020]. It is also an important cause hospitalization and morbitidity among all age groups, including seniors, and are responsible for an estimated 10% of all years lived with a disability globally [@connolly_woo_lampron_perry_2018] [@World_Health_Organization_2021]. To combat this, dedicated trauma centers exist that have been shown to lower mortality but also improve functional outcome in trauma patients [@Nirula_Brasel_2006]. 

Trauma teams are multidisciplinary and operate in these centers. They consist of individuals from the specialities of emergency medicine, surgery, intensive care, nursing and support staff and are lead by a team leader. Their aim is to rapidly assess and stabilise the patient, prioritise their injuries and arrange for site of definitive care. Emergency physicians are often the personnel activating the trauma code using anatomical and physiological criterias, mechanism of injury and information obtained from emergency service personnel.

Trauma patients brought to trauma centers may receive immedidiate or delayed treatment depending on what protocols are present at the facility and how they are being followed [@ryb2012delayed].

Methods
=======

*Refer to the appropriate reporting guideline for details. If you are
developing, updating or validating a clinical prediction model then
use
[TRIPOD](https://www.equator-network.org/reporting-guidelines/tripod-statement/). If
you are conducting an observational study, for example a cohort or
case control study in which you assess associations between some
exposure and an outcome then use
[STROBE](https://www.equator-network.org/reporting-guidelines/strobe/).
